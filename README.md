# Stepin_EmbeddedCproject-
## Introduction
The main feature of this project is to moniter the temperature of seat of a vehicles.Esespecially is it is used for the european countries because the temperatures in the those countries are low so using this concept we can moniter the temperature of seat.In these days everyone is looking for easy way of living and the main aim of this project is to control the temperature of seat whenever the passangers are sitting we can monitor the heat of the seat.

## USED COMPONENTS

1.Temperature sensor

2.switches

3.Display

4.led

5.ATmega328

## FEATURES
1. It determines whether the persons are existed or not.

2. If yes it will gives the indication and there we can see the temperature in the screen.
 
3. Then the person can monitor the temperature by his own.

## 

## SWOT ANALYSIS:Strength's,Weaknesses,Opportunties,Threats.

## STRENGTHS

1.Everyone in the vehicle can monitor.

2.Low cost for the design.

## WEAKNESSES

1.Its only used in the places where the temperatures are too low.

2.Outsiders cannot monitor.

## OPPORTUNITY

1.Using this technique we can stablise the body temperature of the person.

## THREATS

1.Its not helpful in moderate or high temperatures.

## 4W's and 1'H

WHAT:Passenger seat and temperature monitoring.

WHERE: Used in vehicles.
